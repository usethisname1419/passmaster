create password lists

worldpasses.py creates passwords based on languages such as ru(russian) ng(nigerian) en(english) fr(french) cn(chinese) fi(finland) no(norwegien) es(spansih)

`python worldpasses.py cn`

it creates random and structured pass words.

i created this because i can never find any other language password lists.




passmaster is kind of the samething without language choices
